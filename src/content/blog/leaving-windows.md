Remember back in the day, you always got taste for a future version of Windows? 95, 98, XP, 7, Vista and to some extent Windows 10. Let's say as time goes on, you notice things at Microsoft just wasn't looking good anymore as years go by and with the release of Windows 11 and the force of "AI" into every product Microsoft makes, you just only now use Windows for software support with having nothing great in mind about it.

That's what i was feeling in a bloated environment with spyware and heavy stuff making my potato laptop unusable. For some time, i have been thinking to leave Windows and go back to what felt like a stable experience and that was Linux. I remember always having old times with it and it always just worked. Open a web browser and nothing goes wrong interrupting you no matter how long you have been browsing or any sort of stuff you could imagine of. 


There're many reasons but there's one enough to explain this whole thing of leaving Windows. I have been not a fan of the direction Microsoft is deciding for Windows. Forcing AI into everything can be good and bad but i mostly think of bad effects regarding this. Millions of devices are unsupported because of the high requirements or sometimes just the TPM that prevents people's modern PCs from upgrading. I will start with some of the reasons here to explain my issue.

# Windows 11 and leftovers
If Windows 11 has to be "modern" then Microsoft has to make sure to get rid of every single leftover existing in Windows in general. The codebase is literally from decades ago always with a fresh paint of coat only for it to get the same thing and the same pattern goes on. I could go on and find a XP Leftover sitting in Windows 11 or i can just easily find that the Areo basic from Vista is still there (much like the setup when booting from an USB/DVD) and there're more leftovers of oldest operating systems than what i just mentioned.

It becomes even dumber when one of the largest examples that is still in Windows 11 is the control panel and many hidden stuff like Windows 7 theme selection that is still present in the codebase. Why would the hell i have to go to control panel or settings just to do one thing? Microsoft has always tried to make a alternative for control panel yet still couldn't finish the one in Windows 10 despite it's been years since it's release and now that we're in Windows 11, it feels like it's even more unfinished for no freaking reason. Even Windows 8 Metro settings still couldn't replace the control panel so this is just a repeating cycle.

It's normal to have leftovers but when Microsoft is literally as a company taking over the world and with their practices and such, it's just shameless to not fully remove the stuff you want and thus present us with more bloatware than ever.


# Windows and the constant, spyware, ads and more!

### Spyware
Microsoft has been infamous for trying to add spyware into every corner of their operating system. They're often hard to disable or even if you disabled them, they will still come back after like a update or so. Sure spyware could be used to improve their products but even to this day, they still manage to fail their users not understanding on what the users really need.

For example, Microsoft thought that start menu is useless as most of the people in Windows 7 barely used it so they decided to entirely remove it starting within Windows 8 which sparked a lot of hate from their users. What they did not know was that, people still use start menu to search for programs/files to open and they spent time fixing 8.0 issues in Windows 8.1 but they did not bring back the start menu.

There're also other examples of Microsoft failing to understand their users but i think you got the idea already

Fact: Originally, they were going to actually bring back the start menu in a certain update but it only made it's way into ARM devices thus not giving a chance to add back start menu to Windows 8 in general. The start menu in question was only added to a Pre-Technical Preview build of Windows 10 and by proxy [build 9780](https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_10_build_9780).


### Ads and forcing people to use their stuff
Ever since Windows 8 or Windows 10, Microsoft tries it's best to force most of the users to use their product. For example Microsoft has attempted [2](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14872464/windows-10-onedrive-ads-inside-file-explorer) [times](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979251/microsoft-file-explorer-ads-windows-11-testing) to put advertisement to their products on File Explorer. One time was in a insider Preview build of Windows 10 for OneDrive and the other this time being in Windows 11 for their "editor".

Microsoft Edge was also largely used for forcing ads on their users a couple of times such as giving excuse to the user when attempting to download Chrome on [there](https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-is-displaying-multiple-edge-ads-on-googles-chrome-download-page). Sometime ago, they made Edge act like [malware](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23851902/microsoft-bing-popups-windows-11-malware) pop-up.
