    Maybe if you look into history, Ancient objects are a deep mystery.

I was playing Minecraft during the summer recess where I was vibing with cocktails in real life but when I entered the game a friend suggested me this abandoned temple and it was 
covered with soul sand and wither skeleton skulls all over the place. I was starting to think was this about the new update or was it just some kind of Easter egg
joke? I went directly inside the temple and it was dark inside the temple but I set off torches to see what was inside it. The only thing inside it was a
lot of soul sand but I found this chest made out of the earth and it was also freaking me out too! when I opened the chest it had a suspicious-looking book that said 
"You came here? For what? Just to start trouble?
t creeped out so I ran out of there and then I was running forward and then I turned back it was GONE! I walked back into my house it became night and then the 
wither showed up it was looking very scary. A few minutes later I saw the thing again and it killed me! I said in the chat who the heck are you? It answered me it 
said "Why do you care? LEAVE ME ALONE AND LEAVE MY WORLD!!!" after when it said that it just disappeared it left a soul sand and then a sign saying "Why do you do this?" 
It was very confusing how the Ancient Wither did it. So I thought this wither is doing nocturnal things. I put a sign again saying "Who are you" A few hours later the Ancient Wither replied on that sign and said," I am the father of all withers..." 
That was the only thing he said so I replied on the sign" Are you more powerful than the Wither Storm?" I was waiting for a few hours again 
and he replied on the sign and said" The Wither Storm? How do you know about it the Wither Storm was believed to be the most powerful wither of all time but not anymore due to its death it can't be created again..." 
So I knew that the Ancient Wither himself knew about it but it was weird how he knew it so badly as usual, I replied to him again with another question to I said "Are you friends with the Wither storm?" So I waited a few more minutes and then he answered quickly he said "No... we were never friends at all it was just maddening to have the Wither Storm unleashed the ancient prophecy says never release it but YOU HAVE REALIZED IT HAVEN'T YOU AND NOW YOU WILL SEE, WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME INSIDE MY HOME DIRECTLY IN THE CAVE RIGHT BEHIND YOU AND IF YOU DON'T COME YOU WILL SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
TO YOU!!!" So I went inside the cave he was there until I typed in the chat I said "Why are you here?" I answered him quietly he said "I am here because this is my time limit time you see when the first one was created we wanted to make a new world for everyone and A NEW WORLD FOR YOU TOO NOW JOIN ME NOW OR ELSE" He answered to me back so I got scared and I 
said to him with an answer the answer was no in the chat he said to me " THAT IS IT YOU ARE DONE GOODBYE" Everything turned into NETHERRACKS AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE WITH SOUL SAND MILLIONS OF GHASTS AND A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN HORRIFICALLY AND THEN IT GLITCHED SO BADLY AND THEN IT EXITED OUT OF THE GAME and then 
it left off with an error so different and not very natural so that was it I didn't understand what this "Ancient Wither" was and what did he know but for sure I never want to see him again...

Moral: The Ancient Wither is a more powerful mob than others because he can destroy the world and other withers.
