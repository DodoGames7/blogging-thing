    Once blood rises in the sky, You know that you're fucked up

Hellos's Sapphire here i know there are many mysteries about Minecraft, and the blood moon is among them, this gives me weird vibes and fears but lets me share my experiences, one day i was playing Minecraft with my neighbor's kid, but he told me that bro i heard that there is a strange phenomenon called a blood moon, hope you know about this, i told him what is the blood moon? He said i don't recall correctly its like a night and if you look at the sky you will see a moon but with blood color with red shades which looks scary to look at it, also the moon appears to be large and glowing red shades, i said oh that is very interesting, I said I will look into it then we both will see that. after surfing on the Internet for 2 hours i saw there is an article that says if you want to see a blood moon in Minecraft use Saturn or satan as the seed, i thought for a while how can that be possible but yeah giving a shoot would be better, i called my neighbor kid and i loaded up seed on the generator BOOM! the world is loaded, and we are in a desert biome. everything was normal
i told him to let's gather the basic items because we needed to prepare for the nighttime, we both agreed and he headed to the mine and i headed to the forest, on the verge of the evening we both caught up with each other 
he told me that he was excited and feared of this mystery as well i told him also i was too, Night came up, and we both were excited but things me disappointed when the moon came out it was a white moon, not a blood one
i told him to look we'd been waiting for the blood moon but the white moon came how that is possible, i thought it might be fake or some flask article, i told him the moon did not come today and maybe waiting more night time would work, he agreed but we  waited more night times but everything was normal and just a regular moon and the mobs didn't spawn with red eyes
at that moment we both became frustrated and started to use curse words against each other but what you won't believe, at that time the blood moon had risen, it was not a normal one it was pure blood, and the all of mobs surrounding us started to attack up
we both panicked and went to the cave and blocked the entrance, the way i noticed that the mobs were running faster than normal also the Minecraft sounds got distorted
we both became scared and agreed that it was friking real, i told him that every mob in the world had gone crazy thank god we had beds at the mineshaft we tried to sleep but it was saying unable to sleep monsters were nearby
there are no monsters, but he told me that the moon was shining over our head and it did not move a single pixel. we both went into trouble and were afraid to look at eventually he peed his pants too
but i told him we had to go to another place or else we would be stuck there forever he agreed and we started to make items such as swords chest plates legging helmets etc, after being fully armored i told him
are you ready?? he replied yes i am ready and i am a bit afraid too, we both broke the blocks and mobs started to attack us, i told him to RUN!! RUN AT ANY COST! DON'T LOOK BEHIND! 
he said AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! i am running we both panicked and started to run faster at any cost!  after a lot of running, we reached the oak aka grassy biome then the moon disappeared and the sun started to come out
i told him how is that, and he told me it was a horror and auspicious experience but suddenly i noticed that smoke was coming from my Xbox sadly the blood moon did a lot of damage to my Xbox and later i bought this at the repair center they told me 
some chips are fried up because of load the blood moon was powerful enough to destroy my Xbox
sadly we could not see the blood moon ever again it was horror and scary too 
but i wish my experience would help the other players to face the same cases

Moral: Once the Blood Moon rises in the Sky: Leave The  World At Any cost because It Will Destroy Your PC or Console Too...
