Sometime during the early years of Undertale indie game, the game broke the internet with thousands and thousands of fans making many things for the game such as battle animations, fan-made songs and so much more.

What largely made the game alive was the amount of alternate timelines many people have made where there was altercations to the original game such as character's roles being swapped, music, etc.

There's however one video i remember that was available during those times, since then it has been privated but i remember what it looked like.


The video began with a low quality of what seems to be a gameplay of the player walking in the judgement hall. The player stops and the camera shows sans in the same room staring at the player, his dialogue box appears but rather than saying something, he only said 3 dots.

Sans's face looked normal just without pupils in his eyes indicating that he's mad at the player for doing something bad. The battle then began but something seemed off. Rather than his boss music, the music instead was a heavily slowed down version of a existing soundtrack within the game itself.

Sans lacked teeth in his mouth and still had the empty eye sockets. No text appears and the player's name was missing. The player in the video attempts to hit Sans using the "Fight" button. The screen gets replaced with a bunch of `9` as the damage done.


It cuts to black screen for a moment then a close up of sans's battle sprite appears. He now had his skull broken and his smile that lacked teeth was now widened. There were some blood over his face and on his shirt.

A text appears above his head saying "TE OBSERVO" which translates to "I WATCH YOU". The screen cuts to black with laughing edited to be deep playing in the background and then the video ends.
