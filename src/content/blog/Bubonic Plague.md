Once upon a time there was a small civilization on the grass biome in the minecraft; it was a small village where people were living a happy and comfortable life.
The village was located next to the river and in front of the oak tree, and there was a small population in that village, though the village was known for the 
talents because every person in the village is genuinely multi-talented; some of them are experts in armor or some of them are experts in farming or trade; things 
were going well. One day a friend of a farmer came from the foreign land (he was the younger brother of the farm; he lived in the town, and he was educated) and told
everyone that there was more advancement in the town, and it was a very big industrial town. The villagers gathered together and heard his story about the town in 
the foreign land. Soon the villagers grew curious and asked him if he was capable of taking us to the town; he replied that yes! I will take everyone to the town.
The village agreed and called for a meeting, and they discussed that we have multi-talent skills, so we are really capable of going to town and earning money so
we can do less work and live happily. After the meeting, a few weeks later they hauled a vessel and headed to the town; everybody was aboard; it took 2 days for
the tiring journey; after the 2 days in the morning, they reached the foreign port, and they landed. But at first glance, they were amazed that town is really big, with many big buildings,
factories, and many shops. They say that he did not lie; he really told us this. The villagers became curious and started to travel the whole town together, and they saw many new innovations
and new instruments or technology for blacksmiths, farmers, etc. after the long tiring journey they became hungry and tired they decided to rent a lodge, the aboarded to the lodge and went their 
own room, the lodge were fancy and its was traditional many high profile or respected peoples came there and their picturer were hanged on the wall, after knowing the room number the headed to the 
room and when the room door opened they got amazed because the bed were made with cotton and furs its comforty also soft, soon when the dinner time came they went downstairs and sat together around a
table and had a delicious dinner after completeing the dinner one of them commented that living in the town is better than village, some of them agreed and some of them refused, but somehow the most of the
people agreed that living the the town is better, after the dinner everyone went to their room and sleeps. At night, 2 am, a rodent bitten one of their legs. (Indeed, this was a large town, but there was a decent amount 
of rodents and roaches; they are not visible during the day, but during the night these nasty rodents come outside.) The guy who got bit cries out, and everyone gathers. Soon everyone became atonished. The old man says that
a few drops of alcohol in the wound would help to decrease the infection, and he would feel well. Yeah, the old man gave alcohol for cure, and everyone went back to sleep. The next day in the morning, they planned to buy some necessities 
such as grain or technology, advanced methods, etc., and they started loading their grains on their vessels, but frankly, the rodents in the town were attracted to the grains, and the rodents started to onboard the vessels because there were small gaps
in the vessel, which was unnoticeable. The next day at evening, they hauled a vessel and aboared on the vessel. The vessel left the land heads to their own village. After 2 days, they arrived at their village. Everyone welcomed them. Those wives were unhappy for their 
absences and were now smiling behind the curtains. The whole village was welcoming them gratefully. Soon everyone gets back to village life, and things are going as well. A months later one day, the guy got bitten by rodents died away for unknown 
causes, his fingernails became gangrine, he got a large abnormal thing on the left amprits also errupting black fluids from there, the village became scared and started to believe that satan may did this, after his death, the villages gathers together and 
telling each others if someone did worst thing satan will took him too, the villagers nodes their heads and accepted the sentences the rodents were on the vessels now on the land the made a nest there and manipulating their owns, few days later the villagers heard that town got under 
the critical pandenic and its origin was unknown peoples were started to dying like the same the man who died, also half of the town were infected to the unknown diesease, and the death toll rising faster than normal soon they started to believe 
that satan started the disasters and everyone dying for that. Being afraid and scared, they started to worship the god. Soon the rodents who were lived under the ground became hungry duo of lack of natural food the folks of rodents started to attack on the village (these rodents were infected with some unknowmn disease) the hoards of rodents
started to destroy farm house, grain storage eventually bitting the villagers, soon the villagers becoming sick, after this pathetic incidents some of them tried to run away some of them tired to stay underground but unfortunately, the rodents took over the all , the grain storage becoming empty and ther rodents 
started to spread away to find more foods soon the villagers started to die, man woman and child started to get worst and painfull abnormal things on their body but without any proper treatments they started to dies away the village became abandoned and empty, duo lack of graves and peoples the dead body is now dried up 
and its now visible on the every house or street or the farm land the unknown disease started to spread in the further away
CONTINUES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Moral: The bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, was a deadly infection that killed millions of Europeans during the Middle Ages. It was spread by infected fleas that traveled on rodents.
